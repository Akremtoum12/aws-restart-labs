# ğŸ§  AWS re/Start Labs by Akrem T.

This repository contains the hands-on labs I completed as part of the **Generation UK & Ireland AWS re/Start** cloud computing bootcamp.

Each lab focuses on building real-world cloud skills using **core AWS services** like EC2, EBS, IAM, and S3 â€” with step-by-step documentation and screenshots.
