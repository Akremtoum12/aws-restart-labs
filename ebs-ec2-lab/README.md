# üì¶ Working with Amazon EBS and EC2

In this lab, I practiced using Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) and EC2.  
This included provisioning storage, attaching it to compute instances, and simulating a real-world backup and recovery scenario using snapshots.

---

## üß™ Lab Objectives

- ‚úÖ Create an EBS volume and attach it to an EC2 instance
- ‚úÖ Format and mount the volume using EC2 Instance Connect
- ‚úÖ Write data to the volume and take a snapshot
- ‚úÖ Restore a new volume from the snapshot and verify the data
